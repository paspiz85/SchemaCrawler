If you download and use the [main SchemaCrawler distribution](https://www.schemacrawler.com/downloads.html#running-examples-locally/),
or the the [SchemaCrawler Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/schemacrawler/schemacrawler/),
you are downloading and using SchemaCrawler distributed along with open-source JDBC drivers.
