# SchemaCrawler MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide a way to allow specialized AI models to be connected directly to your development environment. MCP servers act as an intermediary to various AI tools, letting MCP clients communicate with custom models that are specialized for specific domains or tasks.

SchemaCrawler MCP Server leverages this protocol to provide advanced database schema analysis capabilities directly within your environment. This allows you to interact with your database using natural language, greatly simplifying tasks such as exploring database structure, understanding relationships between tables, and generating SQL queries.
